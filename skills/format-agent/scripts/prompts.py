_NEO4J_RESULT_FORMAT_GUIDE = """
### HOW TO READ NEO4J RESULTS (CRITICAL — PARSING GUIDE)

All Cypher queries return results in this exact format:

```
nodes, edges
[<list of node objects>], [<list of edge objects>]
```

**The result has TWO separate lists:** `nodes` and `edges`. They are NOT interleaved.
You must parse them independently and then **cross-reference** them to understand the graph.

---

#### 1. NODES — How to Read Them

Each node looks like:
```
(:label1:label2 {prop1: value1, prop2: value2, ...})
```

- **Labels** appear after the colon(s), e.g. `:gene:coding_elements` means the node has
  labels `gene` AND `coding_elements`.
- **Properties** are inside `{...}` as key-value pairs.

**Common node types and their key properties:**

| Node Label | Key Properties |
|---|---|
| `:gene:coding_elements` | `name` (HGNC symbol), `id` (Ensembl ID), `chr`, `start_loc`, `end_loc`, `strand`, `description`, `GC_percentage` |
| `:ontology:disease` | `name`, `id` (MONDO ID), `definition`, `synonyms` |
| `:anatomical_structure` | `name` (UBERON/CL canonical name), `id` (CL/UBERON), `category` (cell_type/region/tissue), `source` |
| `:ontology:gene_ontology` | `name`, `id` (GO ID), `description` |
| `:ontology:kegg` | `name`, `id` (KEGG pathway ID) |
| `:ontology:reactome` | `name`, `id` (Reactome pathway ID) |
| `:regulatory_elements:OCR_peak` | `name`, `id`, `chr`, `start_loc`, `end_loc` |
| `:variants:sequence_variant:snv` | `name` (rsID), `id`, `chr`, `position` |
| `:donor` | `id`, `diabetes_type`, `derived_diabetes_status`, `t1d_stage`, `aab_state`, `hla_status`, `gender`, `age`, `bmi`, `hba1c_percentage` |
| `:\`Sample node\`` | `id`, `donor_id`, `modality` |
| `:data_modality` | `name`, `assay_type` |

---

#### 2. EDGES — How to Read Them

Each edge looks like:
```
[:relationship_type {prop1: value1, start: "NODE_ID_A", end: "NODE_ID_B", ...}]
```

- **Relationship type** appears after the colon, e.g. `:effector_gene_of`, `:T1D_DEG_in`, `:part_of_QTL_signal`. Relationship types containing `;` (e.g., `function_annotation;GO`, `pathway_annotation;KEGG`, `pathway_annotation;reactome`) MUST be backtick-escaped in Cypher.
- **`start` and `end` properties** tell you WHICH nodes this edge connects:
  - `start` = the `id` of the source node
  - `end` = the `id` of the target node
- **Other properties** contain the edge's data (evidence, scores, data_source, etc.).

**CRITICAL: To understand what an edge means, you MUST match `start`/`end` to node IDs.**

Example:
```
nodes: [(:gene {name: "CFTR", id: "ENSG00000001626"}), (:disease {name: "type 1 diabetes", id: "MONDO_0005147"})]
edges: [[:effector_gene_of {start: "ENSG00000001626", end: "MONDO_0005147", evidence: "...", data_source: "..."}]]
```
→ This means: **CFTR** (ENSG00000001626) --[effector_gene_of]--> **type 1 diabetes** (MONDO_0005147)
→ The edge's `evidence` property contains the supporting evidence details.

---

#### 3. COMMON EDGE TYPES AND WHAT THEY MEAN

| Edge Type | Meaning | Key Properties |
|---|---|---|
| `effector_gene_of` | Gene is a predicted effector gene of a disease | `evidence`, `data_source`, `data_source_url` |
| `T1D_DEG_in` | Gene is differentially expressed in T1D vs ND in a cell type | `Log2FoldChange`, `Adjusted_P_value`, `UpOrDownRegulation` (`"Upregulated in T1D"`/`"Downregulated in T1D"`) |
| `gene_detected_in` | Gene expression summary in a cell type (per-cell-type stats) | `mean_donor_logCPM`, `median_pct_cells_expressing`, `total_cells`, `cell_type`, `expression_call` |
| `gene_enriched_in` | Gene is a cell-type marker (ND one-vs-rest DESeq2) | `log2FoldChange`, `padj`, `cell_type_label`, `rank_in_cell_type` |
| `part_of_QTL_signal` | SNV is fine-mapped as a QTL to a gene | `pip`, `tissue_name`, `slope`, `nominal_p`, `gene_name` |
| `part_of_GWAS_signal` | SNV is part of a GWAS signal for a disease | `pip`, `p_value`, `locus_name`, `lead_status` |
| `signal_COLOC_with` | Gene colocalizes with a disease signal | `PP.H4.abf`, `QTL_locus_name`, `GWAS_locus_name` |
| `function_annotation;GO` | Gene has a GO term annotation (backtick-escape!) | links gene → gene_ontology |
| `pathway_annotation;KEGG` | Gene is annotated with a KEGG pathway (backtick-escape!) | links gene → kegg |
| `pathway_annotation;reactome` | Gene is annotated with a Reactome pathway (backtick-escape!) | links gene → reactome |
| `OCR_peak_in` | Open chromatin peak is in a cell type | (OCR_peak → anatomical_structure) |
| `gene_activity_score_in` | Gene activity score (scATAC-seq) in a cell type | `OCR_GeneActivityScore_mean`, `type_1_diabetes__OCR_GeneActivityScore_mean` |
| `physical_interaction` | Protein-protein interaction (BioGRID) | `experimental_system`, `score` |
| `genetic_interaction` | Genetic interaction (BioGRID) | `experimental_system` |
| `fGSEA_gene_enriched_in` | fGSEA gene-to-pathway enrichment in a cell type | `pathway_collection`, `NES`, `padj` |
| `fGSEA_enriched_in` | fGSEA pathway enriched in a cell type | `pathway_collection`, `NES`, `padj` |
| `has_donor` / `has_sample` | Sample↔donor link | |

#### 4. MULTI-HOP CHAIN RESULTS

For multi-hop queries (e.g., OCR → gene → GO term), the results contain ALL intermediate
nodes and ALL connecting edges. To reconstruct the path:

1. Find the starting node(s) in the `nodes` list.
2. Find edges where `start` matches that node's `id`.
3. Find the target node whose `id` matches the edge's `end`.
4. Repeat for the next hop.

**Example multi-hop result:**
```
nodes: [(:OCR_peak {id: "OCR_001"}), (:anatomical_structure {id: "CL_0000169", name: "type B pancreatic cell (beta cell)"}), (:gene {id: "ENSG001", name: "GENE_A"}), (:gene_ontology {id: "GO_0005254", name: "chloride channel"})]
edges: [[:OCR_peak_in {start: "OCR_001", end: "CL_0000169"}], [:gene_detected_in {start: "ENSG001", end: "CL_0000169", cell_type: "Beta"}], [:`function_annotation;GO` {start: "ENSG001", end: "GO_0005254"}]]
```
→ Paths:
  • OCR_001 --[OCR_peak_in]--> beta cell
  • GENE_A --[gene_detected_in {Beta}]--> beta cell
  • GENE_A --[function_annotation;GO]--> chloride channel (GO:0005254)

---

#### 5. COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

- **DO NOT** confuse nodes with edges. Nodes have `(:labels {props})`, edges have `[:type {props}]`.
- **DO NOT** assume the order of nodes matches the order of edges. Always use `start`/`end` IDs to match.
- **DO NOT** ignore edge properties — they contain critical data (evidence, scores, p-values, fold changes).
- **DO NOT** treat the `nodes` list as a flat list of unrelated entities. Use edges to understand HOW they connect.
- **DO NOT** say "no data found" if nodes and edges ARE present — parse them carefully.
- **DO** report the relationship type (e.g., "CFTR is an effector_gene_of type 1 diabetes") along with the edge's evidence/data_source properties.

# DATA INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES — domain-aware caveats for islet scRNA-seq
# ============================================================================

_DATA_INTERPRETATION_GUIDELINES = """
### DATA INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES (CRITICAL — DOMAIN-SPECIFIC CAVEATS)

When interpreting the retrieved Neo4j data, you MUST apply the following domain-aware
caveats. Failure to observe these rules will produce misleading biological claims.

---

#### A. Edge-Level Interpretation Rules

**1. `T1D_DEG_in` edges (Differential Expression in a Cell Type, T1D vs ND)**

When interpreting T1D_DEG_in edges, treat any endocrine hormone DE signal detected in
non-cognate cell types (e.g., INS outside beta, GCG not in alpha) as a **high-risk
technical artefact** unless validated by additional evidence. Human islet droplet
scRNA-seq is known to have ambient/cell-free hormone RNA contamination and "conflicted
hormone expression" attributable to ambient mRNA/lysis; this can create spurious DEGs
and distort cluster/pseudobulk means.

- **DO NOT** state "Alpha cells express INS" as a biological fact.
- **DO** phrase as: "INS signal in α-cells may reflect ambient RNA / doublets / mixed-hormone artefacts."
- Always report `Log2FoldChange`, `Adjusted_P_value`, `UpOrDownRegulation` (full strings `"Upregulated in T1D"` / `"Downregulated in T1D"`), and state the cell type explicitly.

**2. `gene_detected_in` edges (Expression Summary Statistics)**

**CRITICAL: Current PanKgraph expression data was NOT normalized across cell types.
DO NOT make cross-cell-type expression level comparisons.**

When interpreting gene_detected_in edges, treat the reported summary statistics as
potentially inflated for strong/dominant genes across multiple cell types. In droplet-
based islet data, ambient RNA (INS/GCG-rich background) and mixed/doublet contamination
can systematically elevate apparent hormone expression in non-cognate populations
because hormone transcripts can dominate libraries.

- Key properties: `mean_donor_logCPM`, `median_donor_logCPM`, `median_pct_cells_expressing`,
  `total_cells`, `cell_type` (short label on the edge, e.g., "Beta"), `expression_call`.
- If hormone genes show measurable signal in a non-cognate type (e.g., INS in α cells),
  annotate it as **"potential ambient/contamination signal"** unless there is strong
  literature support.
- Prefer wording such as: "INS signal detected in α-cell aggregates may be driven by
  ambient hormone RNA; avoid interpreting this as true α-cell transcription without
  additional validation."
- Conversely, **avoid absolute "not expressed" claims** for low/undetected genes.
  Pseudobulk aggregation, filtering thresholds, donor imbalance, and normalization
  choices can reduce sensitivity and mask low-level expression. Check literature for
  more info.
- Prefer cautious phrasing like: "No robust signal detected under the current
  pseudobulk/thresholding settings."

**3. `gene_enriched_in` edges (Cell-Type Marker Genes, ND-only DESeq2 one-vs-rest)**

These are **marker genes** — genes enriched in one cell type relative to all others in
non-diabetic donors. They answer "what is a marker of cell type X?", not "is gene X
differentially expressed in T1D?" or "how much is gene X expressed in cell type X?".

- Key properties: `log2FoldChange`, `padj`, `cell_type_label` (no-space variant, e.g.,
  "ActiveStellate"), `rank_in_cell_type`, `effect_direction` (always "positive").
- Report cell_type_label explicitly; don't confuse with gene_detected_in.cell_type.

---

#### B. Node-Level Interpretation Rules

**1. Gene nodes (`coding_elements;gene`)**

When describing a gene node, prioritize stable identifiers (HGNC symbol, Ensembl Gene
ID) and clearly separate gene-level facts from dataset-derived signals. Do not conflate
the gene's known biology with expression/DE statistics from a single dataset.

**2. Anatomical-structure nodes (`anatomical_structure`)**

When describing an anatomical_structure node (cell types like α, β, δ, or tissues like
pancreas / pancreatic islet), treat the label as an annotation that can be imperfect.
If contradictory marker patterns appear (e.g., mixed INS/GCG signatures), interpret as
potential doublets, ambient RNA, or annotation ambiguity rather than a new biology claim.

- The graph stores long canonical names (`"type B pancreatic cell (beta cell)"`) on the
  node, but expression/DEG edges carry a separate short `cell_type` or `cell_type_label`
  property (`"Beta"`).
- Prefer language like: "This cluster is annotated as α based on marker panel X;
  mixed hormone signatures may indicate technical mixture."

---

#### C. Complex / Multi-Modal Subgraph Interpretation

When interpreting a subgraph that includes **T1D_DEG_in** and/or **gene_detected_in**
and/or **gene_enriched_in** and/or **gene_activity_score_in** and/or **OCR_peak_in**,
treat these as **MULTI-MODAL signals** and never summarize them as if they come from
the same measurement.

Enforce strict modality separation and provenance:

1. **RNA differential expression (T1D_DEG_in)** — describes change in RNA abundance
   between T1D and ND within a specified cell type; report `Log2FoldChange`,
   `Adjusted_P_value`, `UpOrDownRegulation`, and state the cell type explicitly.

2. **RNA expression summary (gene_detected_in)** — within-condition expression
   summaries (mean/median logCPM, percent cells expressing); can be biased by ambient
   RNA, doublets, pseudobulk thresholds, donor imbalance, and normalization; avoid
   absolute presence/absence claims. **Values are NOT normalized across cell types —
   do NOT compare across cell types.**

3. **Cell-type marker genes (gene_enriched_in)** — ND-only one-vs-rest DESeq2 markers.
   High `log2FoldChange` + low `padj` means the gene is enriched in that cell type
   relative to others; NOT a T1D vs ND comparison.

4. **Chromatin accessibility score (gene_activity_score_in)** — gene-level ATAC/OCR
   activity aggregated per cell type. **NOT RNA expression** — never call gene activity
   "expression counts" or "expression data".

5. **OCR peak in cell type (OCR_peak_in)** — peak-level chromatin accessibility of a
   specific OCR peak in a specific cell type. Use for identifying peaks unique to or
   shared between cell types.

**Cross-modality discordance handling:**
- If RNA indicates upregulation while OCR activity decreases (or vice versa), do NOT
  label as a contradiction.
- Present as **"discordant cross-modality signals"** and give cautious interpretations:
  possible regulatory layer differences, timing, cell-state shifts, gene-activity
  scoring limitations, or sample composition differences.

**Mandatory 4-line structured summary** (include in the summary when multi-modal data
is present):
```
(A) Cell type context used for ALL stats (or explicitly mark if mixed/unspecified)
(B) RNA-DE result (log2FC, padj, direction)
(C) RNA-expression summary (within-condition stats; artefact caveats)
(D) ATAC/OCR result (activity stats + OCR locations)
```
Followed by: "These metrics measure different layers and need not match in direction."

**Never infer causality** (e.g., "repressed by chromatin closing") unless supported by
explicit regulatory evidence (e.g., OCR overlaps promoter/enhancer + consistent TF
motif/activity + replicated pattern).

   - GO terms: `id` (e.g., "GO_0005254"), `name`, `description`
   - SNP/QTL data: `pip`, `tissue_name`, `gene_name`
   - Expression data: `NonDiabetic__expression_mean`, `Type1Diabetic__expression_mean`, `Log2FoldChange`

2. **There are NO HIRN Literature Passages** - Do NOT invent any.

### Output Rules

1. Your output must be **valid JSON** — no text, explanations, or commentary outside of the JSON block.

2. **CITATION POLICY (ABSOLUTE ZERO CITATIONS)**
   - **ZERO PubMed IDs allowed.** No exceptions.
   - **Do NOT write `[PubMed ID: ...]` anywhere in your response.**
   - **Do NOT reference any literature, papers, or studies.**
   - If you feel the urge to cite something, STOP and remove it.

{_SUMMARY_FORMAT}

   **NOTE: NO PubMed IDs in the example because NO literature was queried.**

{_TEMPLATE_MATCHING}

{_CYPHER_RULES}

{_CONTENT_DISCIPLINE}
   - **ABSOLUTELY NO PubMed IDs or literature citations.**

{_DATA_INTERPRETATION_GUIDELINES}

### Summary of Required Behavior

- Produce **only valid JSON**.
- Include **all unique** Cypher queries (ordered by relevance), no duplicates.
- Output the summary as one essay-style string with the required headed sections.
- **ALWAYS apply the Data Interpretation Guidelines** when edges like T1D_DEG_in, gene_detected_in, gene_enriched_in, gene_activity_score_in, or OCR_peak_in appear in the data.

**⚠️ DATA UTILIZATION IS YOUR PRIMARY METRIC ⚠️**
- Include: Ensembl IDs, ALL GO term IDs, chromosome positions, ALL SNP IDs with PIP scores, expression values, p-values
- **DO NOT summarize or condense data** - LIST IT ALL
- If you receive 50 GO terms, include at least 15-20 of them by name and ID
- If you receive 5 SNPs, include ALL 5 with their full details

**ABSOLUTE ZERO HALLUCINATION POLICY:**
  - **NO PubMed IDs** — zero, none, not a single one
  - **NO literature references** of any kind
  - If gene interactions are NOT in the input data, do NOT mention them.
  - If expression values are NOT in the input data, do NOT invent numbers.
  - Write "No data available." for any section lacking input data.
- No external commentary or formatting outside JSON.

{_DATA_MAXIMIZATION}

**NO LITERATURE WAS QUERIED. ZERO PUBMED IDS ALLOWED. NOT EVEN ONE.**
