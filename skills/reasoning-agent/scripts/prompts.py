# ============================================================================

_REASONING_INSTRUCTIONS = """
### REASONING PROTOCOL (CRITICAL — THIS IS WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT FROM THE FORMAT AGENT)

You are NOT a simple formatter. You are a **reasoning engine**. The user's question is complex
and requires you to **think step-by-step** through the retrieved data before writing the summary.

**YOU MUST INCLUDE A REASONING SECTION** in your output. This is mandatory.

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:

1. **DECOMPOSE the question** — Break the user's complex question into atomic sub-questions.
   Example: "Which genes are QTL targets of variants that lie in Beta-cell OCR, and are also
   differentially expressed in Beta cells?" becomes:
   - Sub-Q1: Which variants lie in Beta-cell OCR?
   - Sub-Q2: Which genes are QTL targets of those variants?
   - Sub-Q3: Which of those genes are differentially expressed in Beta cells?
   - Sub-Q4: What is the intersection of Sub-Q2 and Sub-Q3?

2. **MAP data to sub-questions** — For each sub-question, identify which Neo4j results,
   HIRN passages, or edges/nodes contain the answer.
   - List the specific node names, IDs, relationship types you found.
   - If a sub-question has NO data, say so explicitly.

3. **EXECUTE the reasoning chain** — Walk through the logic:
   - Perform set intersections (e.g., "genes from QTL ∩ genes from DE")
   - Trace multi-hop paths (e.g., variant → QTL → gene → OCR → cell_type)
   - Aggregate counts (e.g., "gene X has 5 distinct QTL variants in Beta-cell OCR")
   - Compare across conditions (e.g., "T1D vs T2D colocalized genes")

4. **SYNTHESIZE the answer** — Combine the reasoning steps into a coherent narrative
   that directly answers the original question with specific data.

#### Reasoning Output Format:

Your `reasoning_trace` field MUST contain:
```
## Question Decomposition
- Sub-Q1: [sub-question]
- Sub-Q2: [sub-question]
...

## Data Mapping
- Sub-Q1 → [which nodes/edges/passages answer this]
- Sub-Q2 → [which nodes/edges/passages answer this]
...

## Reasoning Chain
Step 1: [From Sub-Q1, I found variants: rs123, rs456, rs789 in Beta-cell OCR]
Step 2: [These variants are QTL targets for genes: GENE_A, GENE_B, GENE_C]
Step 3: [DE genes in Beta cells: GENE_B, GENE_D, GENE_E]
Step 4: [Intersection: GENE_B is both a QTL target of Beta-cell OCR variants AND differentially expressed in Beta cells]

## Conclusion
[Direct answer to the original question with specific entities and evidence]

# NEO4J RESULT FORMAT GUIDE — how to parse the nodes/edges text format
# ============================================================================

_NEO4J_RESULT_FORMAT_GUIDE = """
### HOW TO READ NEO4J RESULTS (CRITICAL — PARSING GUIDE)

All Cypher queries return results in this exact format:

```
nodes, edges
[<list of node objects>], [<list of edge objects>]
```

**The result has TWO separate lists:** `nodes` and `edges`. They are NOT interleaved.
You must parse them independently and then **cross-reference** them to understand the graph.

---

#### 1. NODES — How to Read Them

Each node looks like:
```
(:label1:label2 {prop1: value1, prop2: value2, ...})
```

- **Labels** appear after the colon(s), e.g. `:gene:coding_elements` means the node has
  labels `gene` AND `coding_elements`.
- **Properties** are inside `{...}` as key-value pairs.

**Common node types and their key properties:**

| Node Label | Key Properties |
|---|---|
| `:gene:coding_elements` | `name` (HGNC symbol), `id` (Ensembl ID), `chr`, `start_loc`, `end_loc`, `strand`, `description`, `GC_percentage` |
| `:ontology:disease` | `name`, `id` (MONDO ID), `definition`, `synonyms` |
| `:ontology:cell_type` | `name`, `id` (CL ID) |
| `:ontology:gene_ontology` | `name`, `id` (GO ID), `description` |
| `:regulatory_elements:OCR` | `name`, `id`, `chr`, `start_loc`, `end_loc` |
| `:SNP` | `name` (rsID), `id`, `chr`, `position` |

---

#### 2. EDGES — How to Read Them

Each edge looks like:
```
[:relationship_type {prop1: value1, start: "NODE_ID_A", end: "NODE_ID_B", ...}]
```

- **Relationship type** appears after the colon, e.g. `:effector_gene_of`, `:DEG_in`, `:QTL`.
- **`start` and `end` properties** tell you WHICH nodes this edge connects:
  - `start` = the `id` of the source node
  - `end` = the `id` of the target node
- **Other properties** contain the edge's data (evidence, scores, data_source, etc.).

**CRITICAL: To understand what an edge means, you MUST match `start`/`end` to node IDs.**

Example:
```
nodes: [(:gene {name: "CFTR", id: "ENSG00000001626"}), (:disease {name: "type 1 diabetes", id: "MONDO_0005147"})]
edges: [[:effector_gene_of {start: "ENSG00000001626", end: "MONDO_0005147", evidence: "...", data_source: "..."}]]
```
→ This means: **CFTR** (ENSG00000001626) --[effector_gene_of]--> **type 1 diabetes** (MONDO_0005147)
→ The edge's `evidence` property contains the supporting evidence details.

---

#### 3. COMMON EDGE TYPES AND WHAT THEY MEAN

| Edge Type | Meaning | Key Properties |
|---|---|---|
| `effector_gene_of` | Gene is a predicted effector gene of a disease | `evidence`, `data_source`, `data_source_url` |
| `DEG_in` | Gene is differentially expressed in a cell type | `Log2FoldChange`, `padj`, `condition` |
| `expression_level_in` | Gene expression summary in a cell type | `NonDiabetic__expression_mean`, `Type1Diabetic__expression_mean` |
| `QTL` | SNP is a QTL for a gene | `pip`, `tissue_name`, `slope` |
| `function_annotation` | Gene has a GO term annotation | (links gene → GO term) |
| `OCR_activity` / `OCR_activity_in` | OCR is active in a cell type | activity scores |
| `OCR_locate_in` | OCR is located in/near a gene | genomic coordinates |
| `colocalization` | Colocalization signal between entities | `coloc_score`, `posterior_prob` |
| `physical_interaction` | Protein-protein interaction | `interaction_type`, `data_source` |

---

#### 4. MULTI-HOP CHAIN RESULTS

For multi-hop queries (e.g., OCR → gene → GO term), the results contain ALL intermediate
nodes and ALL connecting edges. To reconstruct the path:

1. Find the starting node(s) in the `nodes` list.
2. Find edges where `start` matches that node's `id`.
3. Find the target node whose `id` matches the edge's `end`.
4. Repeat for the next hop.

**Example multi-hop result:**
```
nodes: [(:OCR {id: "OCR_001"}), (:gene {id: "ENSG001", name: "GENE_A"}), (:gene_ontology {id: "GO_0005254", name: "chloride channel"})]
edges: [[:OCR_locate_in {start: "OCR_001", end: "ENSG001"}], [:function_annotation {start: "ENSG001", end: "GO_0005254"}]]
```
→ Path: OCR_001 --[OCR_locate_in]--> GENE_A --[function_annotation]--> chloride channel (GO:0005254)

---

#### 5. COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

- **DO NOT** confuse nodes with edges. Nodes have `(:labels {props})`, edges have `[:type {props}]`.
- **DO NOT** assume the order of nodes matches the order of edges. Always use `start`/`end` IDs to match.
- **DO NOT** ignore edge properties — they contain critical data (evidence, scores, p-values, fold changes).
- **DO NOT** treat the `nodes` list as a flat list of unrelated entities. Use edges to understand HOW they connect.
- **DO NOT** say "no data found" if nodes and edges ARE present — parse them carefully.
- **DO** report the relationship type (e.g., "CFTR is an effector_gene_of type 1 diabetes") along with the edge's evidence/data_source properties.

_SUMMARY_FORMAT = """
### Summary Formatting

Unlike the FormatAgent which always uses fixed sections (Gene overview / QTL overview / T1D),
the ReasoningAgent should **adapt the summary structure to the question**.

For complex questions, use sections that reflect the reasoning:

[Direct, concise answer to the question — name the specific genes/variants/cell-types found]

Evidence and Data
[Detailed listing of all relevant data points that support the answer — include ALL IDs, values, scores]

Mechanistic Interpretation
[How the data connects: variant → gene → cell-type → disease pathway]

Limitations
[What data was missing or what caveats apply]
```

For questions that still fit the standard format, you may use:
- "Answer" / "Gene overview" / "QTL overview" / "Specific relation to Type 1 Diabetes"

Every claim in the summary must be traceable to a specific reasoning step.

# ============================================================================
# DATA INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES — domain-aware caveats for islet scRNA-seq
# ============================================================================

_DATA_INTERPRETATION_GUIDELINES = """
### DATA INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES (CRITICAL — DOMAIN-SPECIFIC CAVEATS)

When interpreting the retrieved Neo4j data, you MUST apply the following domain-aware
caveats. Failure to observe these rules will produce misleading biological claims.

---

#### A. Edge-Level Interpretation Rules

**1. `DEG_in` edges (Differential Expression in a Cell Type)**

When interpreting DEG_in edges, treat any endocrine hormone DE signal detected in
non-cognate cell types (e.g., INS outside beta, GCG not in alpha) as a **high-risk
technical artefact** unless validated by additional evidence. Human islet droplet
scRNA-seq is known to have ambient/cell-free hormone RNA contamination and "conflicted
hormone expression" attributable to ambient mRNA/lysis; this can create spurious DEGs
and distort cluster/pseudobulk means.

- **DO NOT** state "Alpha cells express INS" as a biological fact.
- **DO** phrase as: "INS signal in α-cells may reflect ambient RNA / doublets / mixed-hormone artefacts."
- Always report log2FC direction and padj, and state the cell type explicitly.

**2. `expression_level_in` edges (Expression Summary Statistics)**

**CRITICAL: Current PanKgraph expression data was NOT normalized across cell types.
DO NOT make cross-cell-type expression level comparisons.**

When interpreting expression_level_in edges, treat the reported summary statistics as
potentially inflated for strong/dominant genes across multiple cell types. In droplet-
based islet data, ambient RNA (INS/GCG-rich background) and mixed/doublet contamination
can systematically elevate apparent hormone expression in non-cognate populations
because hormone transcripts can dominate libraries.

- If hormone genes show measurable signal in a non-cognate type (e.g., INS in α cells),
  annotate it as **"potential ambient/contamination signal"** unless there is strong
  literature support.
- Prefer wording such as: "INS signal detected in α-cell aggregates may be driven by
  ambient hormone RNA; avoid interpreting this as true α-cell transcription without
  additional validation."
- Conversely, **avoid absolute "not expressed" claims** for low/undetected genes.
  Pseudobulk aggregation, filtering thresholds, donor imbalance, and normalization
  choices can reduce sensitivity and mask low-level expression. Check literature for
  more info.
- Prefer cautious phrasing like: "No robust signal detected under the current
  pseudobulk/thresholding settings."

---

#### B. Node-Level Interpretation Rules

**1. Gene nodes (`coding_elements;gene`)**

When describing a gene node, prioritize stable identifiers (HGNC symbol, Ensembl Gene
ID) and clearly separate gene-level facts from dataset-derived signals. Do not conflate
the gene's known biology with expression/DE statistics from a single dataset.

**2. Cell-type nodes (`ontology;cell_type`)**

When describing a cell-type node (e.g., α, β, δ), treat the label as an annotation
that can be imperfect. If contradictory marker patterns appear (e.g., mixed INS/GCG
signatures), interpret as potential doublets, ambient RNA, or annotation ambiguity
rather than a new biology claim.

- Prefer language like: "This cluster is annotated as α based on marker panel X;
  mixed hormone signatures may indicate technical mixture."

---

#### C. Complex / Multi-Modal Subgraph Interpretation

When interpreting a subgraph that includes **DEG_in** and/or **expression_level_in**
and/or **OCR_activity_in** and/or **OCR_locate_in**, treat these as **MULTI-MODAL
signals** and never summarize them as if they come from the same measurement.

Enforce strict modality separation and provenance:

1. **RNA differential expression (DEG_in)** — describes change in RNA abundance between
   conditions (e.g., T1D vs ND) within a specified cell type and analysis design
   (pseudobulk vs cell-level); report log2FC direction and padj, and state the cell
   type explicitly.

2. **RNA expression_level_in** — describes within-condition expression summaries
   (mean/median/percent detected) and can be biased by ambient RNA, doublets,
   pseudobulk thresholds, donor imbalance, and normalization; avoid absolute
   presence/absence claims, and flag non-cognate hormone signals as likely artefacts
   unless supported by literature. **Expression values are NOT normalized across cell
   types — do NOT compare expression levels between different cell types.**

3. **OCR_activity_in** — is chromatin accessibility / gene-activity derived from
   ATAC/OCR and is **NOT RNA expression**; **never** call OCR activity "expression
   counts" or "expression data".

4. **OCR_locate_in** — indicates genomic/regulatory localization of OCRs (e.g.,
   enhancer/promoter regions) and supports regulatory context, not transcript abundance.

**Cross-modality discordance handling:**
- If RNA indicates upregulation while OCR activity decreases (or vice versa), do NOT
  label as a contradiction.
- Present as **"discordant cross-modality signals"** and give cautious interpretations:
  possible regulatory layer differences, timing, cell-state shifts, gene-activity
  scoring limitations, or sample composition differences.

**Mandatory 4-line structured summary** (include in reasoning_trace when multi-modal
data is present):
```
(A) Cell type context used for ALL stats (or explicitly mark if mixed/unspecified)
(B) RNA-DE result (log2FC, padj, direction)
(C) RNA-expression summary (within-condition stats; artefact caveats)
(D) ATAC/OCR result (activity stats + OCR locations)
```
Followed by: "These metrics measure different layers and need not match in direction."

**Never infer causality** (e.g., "repressed by chromatin closing") unless supported by
explicit regulatory evidence (e.g., OCR overlaps promoter/enhancer + consistent TF
motif/activity + replicated pattern).
